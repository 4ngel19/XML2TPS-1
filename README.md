# **xml2tps**

<br>

This is a small, useful program for transforming output files from [Ml-Morph](https://github.com/agporto/ml-morph), converting them from `.xml` to `.tps` format. In other words, it is an xml to tps converter.

Ml-Morph is a machine-learning-based software tool that enables the extraction of the shape of individuals of interest using automatically placed coordinates. With these shapes, researchers can conduct subsequent **Geometric Morphometrics** analyses. Although it is a powerful tool with a high degree of accuracy, researchers may sometimes want to adjust the position of specific landmarks, add curves to capture additional variation, or include a scale for each individual to explore the effects of allometry in their dataset.

This small application is cross-platform as it is developed in both [**Python**](/Python) and [**R**](/R). Its execution and installation are straightforward; we have included usage instructions and listed the necessary libraries to ensure it runs successfully in either language. <br><br>
